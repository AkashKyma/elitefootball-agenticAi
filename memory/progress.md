# Progress

## Current Status
Initial repository bootstrap completed at the scaffold level.

## Completed
- created Python application package structure
- created API, agent, scraping, database, and service module placeholders
- created required memory files
- added starter dependency list and `.gitignore`
- completed architecture planning for MVP player + match database schema
- defined the target domain tables as clubs, players, matches, and stats
- identified SQL schema and ORM models as the required implementation outputs
- implemented normalized SQLAlchemy ORM models for clubs, players, matches, and stats
- added SQL schema output at `app/db/schema.sql`
- replaced the placeholder player-only model with the MVP football schema
- completed architecture planning for a Playwright-based Transfermarkt scraper
- defined raw HTML and parsed data storage as required outputs for scraping work
- added Playwright-backed scraping modules for browser access, parsing, storage, and Transfermarkt orchestration
- implemented raw HTML and parsed JSON persistence for Transfermarkt scraping outputs
- completed architecture planning for a Bronze/Silver/Gold data pipeline
- added a dedicated pipeline package with Bronze manifest generation, Silver table cleaning, and Gold feature generation

## Next Steps
- validate pipeline outputs against real scraped Transfermarkt and FBref artifacts
- connect cleaned Silver tables and Gold features to database ingestion and analysis workflows
- validate scraping selectors against live Transfermarkt and FBref pages and refine parser accuracy
- seed tracked club records for IDV + five clubs
- add tests for parsing behavior, storage outputs, pipeline transforms, and backend entrypoints
- refine the coordinator workflow between agents

## Working Rules
All future tasks MUST:
- read memory before work
- update memory after work
